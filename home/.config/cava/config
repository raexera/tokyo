[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.                       # Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires                         # ncurses output method and a terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.
# if supported, ncurses mode will be forced on if user defined colors are used.
# default is to keep current terminal color
 background = default
 foreground = default

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors (and thereby ncurses mode) are supported,
# background must also be defined in hex  or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off.
# You can define as many as 8 different colors. They range from bottom to top of screen

[smoothing]

# Set gravity percentage for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
# Accepts only non-negative values. 50 means half gravity, 200 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
